# Movies and Series
**This code is a movies and series playlist maker.**

## Overview
This is a simple *Python* code that creates personalized playlists for movies and series. It is still pretty raw; I made it through a course about *classes* and *functions* in the **Alura** website. This initial version serves as a foundation, showcasing the basics of how *classes* and *functions* can be used to build a functional application. Soon, it will be enhanced with new features and become a useful program.

## Features
### Current features:<br>
• Creates playlists;<br>
• Organizes by category;<br>
• Differs movies from series;<br>
• Likes the shows.

### Future features:<br>
• User interface;<br>

## Notes
**This project was made through a course in the [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) website.<br>
The Program is still under development.**
